# Power_BI_Dashboard_Project
Built a Power BI Dashboard to track KPIs (sales, revenue, profit, returns), compare regional performance, analyse product-level trends, and identify high-value customers.
Connected and transformed the raw data using Power Query Editor. Built a relational data model. Created calculated columns and measures with Advanced DAX. Finally designed an interactive dashboard to visualize the data.
